# SwimInstructionProgram

Hello, this is a project to assist with creating swim practices.
This is my first project that I have ever worked on so in general
it will most likely look rough and have a lot of inefficienies. I
have taken some introductory level java courses which is the only 
language I know. If you are reading this and have any suggestions 
on how to streamline any portion of it, feel free to contact me as 
I would love the feedback. Also this project is completely open source
so feel free to use the program when it is finished or to take any parts 
from it. If you do take a signifigant amount of the code, please contact me
so I can be referenced. If you are interested in working on the project
with me, contact me and I would be more than happy to work with you.
